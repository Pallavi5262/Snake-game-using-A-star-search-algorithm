Developed a grid-based Snake game using Python and Pygame, integrating A pathfinding* for guiding the snake towards power-ups (lifelines).

Key Features:
Implemented A algorithm* for dynamic pathfinding.
Introduced lifelines (hearts) placed at perfect square positions on the grid.
Collision detection and auto-reset mechanism for limited lifelines.
Smooth grid-based movement and interactive UI with score tracking.

Technologies Used:
Python, Pygame (Game Development)
A* Algorithm (Pathfinding)
Mathematical Optimizations (Perfect Squares for Lifelines)

Project Impact:
Showcases game development skills with AI-driven movement.
Demonstrates proficiency in search algorithms and grid-based logic.
Enhances problem-solving abilities in real-time decision-making scenarios.
